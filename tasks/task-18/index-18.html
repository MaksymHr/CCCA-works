                    <td>She is Shirou's Servant, an agile but powerful warrior. Loyal, independent, and reserved, Saber acts coldly but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the "Most Outstanding," with excellent ratings in all categories. Since her Master cannot effectively provide her with mana, she minimizes her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is frustrated by Shirou's "protective" tendencies, believing his erratic and reckless behavior will jeopardize her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.</td>

He is a gluttonous warthog and the best friend of Timon. Most animals are wary and dismissive of Pumbaa due to his pungent odor, but he remains happy-go-lucky by following a philosophy called Hakuna Matata.</td>
